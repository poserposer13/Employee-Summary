## Installation 
They will need to install node.js and a command terminal.

## Description
This application will prompt the user to provide the role an employee has. Based off the answer provided, it will ask a series of questions related to that role. The application will then create html from the class and subclasses that were created. Finally, it will use the created html to write a new html file that places everything in its place. 

## Usage
They will run node index.js and they will answer the prompts. The initial prompt will determine what questions are asked. 

## Credits / Contributing
